# jspsych-nv-core

This is a student project of Mariia and Sofia under super vision of Natalia.

# This experiment consists of two main parts

1. A Lexical Decision (LD) task
2. A Picture Naming (PN) task where the participant names pictures. The participant
   needs to name the picture according to the national British and Dutch flags.

The tasks need to be done in counterbalanced order. So, for e.g. odd participants
the LD is administered first and then the PN second and for even numbered the
other way around.

The LD task is in the ld folder and the PN task will be put in the pn subfolder.
